# Privacy Policy – FeedNap

_Last updated: 29 November 2025_

FeedNap ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled in the FeedNap mobile app.

---

## 1. No Personal Account, No Login

FeedNap does not require you to create an account or log in. We do not collect, store, or share personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or location.

The only data in the app is the baby-related information you choose to enter.

---

## 2. Local Data Storage Only

All data you add in FeedNap — including breastfeeding sessions, bottle feeds, sleep logs, and nappy/diaper changes — is stored **locally on your device**.

- Data is **not** sent to our servers.
- Data is **not** shared with third parties.
- Sync or sharing features are **not** currently implemented.

If we introduce optional sync or sharing in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated to explain how that data is handled.

---

## 3. Baby & Care Data

FeedNap is intended for caregivers to log information about a baby or child, such as:

- Feeding (breast, bottle, volume, side)
- Sleep start/stop times
- Nappy/diaper changes (wet/dirty/both)
- Optional notes or metadata, if such features are added later

This information is visible only on your device unless you choose to share your device or backups yourself (for example, via system backups like iCloud or Google Drive).

You are responsible for:

- What you choose to store in the app  
- Who has access to your device and system backups  

---

## 4. Permissions

If additional permissions are needed in the future, they will be requested by the operating system and described in an updated version of this policy.

---

## 5. No Third-Party Analytics or Ads

FeedNap does **not** include:

- Analytics SDKs (e.g. Firebase Analytics, Google Analytics)
- Advertising SDKs or ad networks
- Social media trackers or third-party profiling tools

We do not track how you use the app.

---

## 6. In-App Purchases

At this time, FeedNap does **not** offer in-app purchases or subscriptions.

If paid features are added in the future, purchases will be processed by the platform’s app store (such as the Apple App Store or Google Play), and this policy will be updated accordingly. We will not store your payment card details.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

FeedNap is designed to be used by **adults** (parents and caregivers) to log information about babies and children. We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children.

Because we do not operate accounts or online services within the app, FeedNap is designed to comply with privacy protections for families and children. As with any app, we recommend that children do not use it unsupervised.

---

## 8. Backup & Deletion of Data

Because data is stored locally on your device:

- If you delete the app, the data stored within the app is typically deleted as well.
- If you back up your device (e.g. iCloud, Google Drive, or other system backups), FeedNap data may be included in those backups according to your device settings.

To remove data from backups, you may need to manage or delete those backups through your device or cloud provider.

We do not have access to your device backups and cannot delete data on your behalf.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.

Significant changes may also be communicated through the app or on an associated website, if applicable.
